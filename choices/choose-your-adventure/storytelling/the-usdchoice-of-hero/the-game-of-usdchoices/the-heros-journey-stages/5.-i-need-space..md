### <mark style="color:purple;">"The work's point of departure is the unity of reality divided into symmetrical and corresponding degrees, planes or worlds. A reality stretched between two poles: the original One (God, the source of all existence), and human (the microcosm, who, with their science brings the dispersion back to its origin, identifying and using their correspondences)."</mark>&#x20;
