## <mark style="background-color:blue;">The Theory of General Relativity</mark>



**The popular Einstein's equation from the** [**Theory of General Relativity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_relativity)**, establishes a 1:1 relation between energy and mass.**

**Here,  c is one of the**[ **universal hard-coded constants of this reality**](../the-fundamental-constants.md)**, encoding the speed of light:**

$$
E = m c^2
$$

## <mark style="background-color:red;">**The Theory of Special Relativity**</mark>



[**Lorentz Special Reality** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special\_relativity)**establishes equations that define a 1:1 relation between energy and frequency ω (the inverse of wavelength) for light (photons).**

**Here,** **♄ is the** [**Planck constant over 2π**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck\_constant) **(another of the universal hard-coded constants of this reality):**

$$
E  = ♄  ω
$$

## <mark style="background-color:green;">**The Uncertainty Principle**</mark>



**One of the most interesting results from quantum mechanics, the** [**Uncertainty Principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty\_principle)**, is an extension of the fact that, ultimately, everything can be expressed as energy in this game:**

$$
Δx Δp ≥ ♄/2
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
Attentive readers with an Astrology background will notice the similarity between the Planck Constant (one of the pillars of the hard science of Quantum Mechanics) and Saturn's symbol. Dr. Max Planck was a magickian as well.
